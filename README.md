# Phasor-Calculator
Do you hate the tedious calculations involving complex numbers when you are doing Phasor Analysis on Circuits? Well, I do, so I made this Python script to allow me (and you) to do those calculations much quickly. This phasor calculator can find the impedance of capacitors and inductors. It can also find the impedance of two components in parallel and two in series. This script also allows you to switch between amplitude-phase form and rectangular form with one simple function. Say goodbye to long calculations with complex conjugates and hello to easy analysis!
